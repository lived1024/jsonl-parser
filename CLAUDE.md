### Key Value Propositions
1. **Instant Visualization**: Real-time parsing and tree display
2. **Large Data Handling**: Optimized for datasets with 1000+ nodes
3. **User Experience**: Responsive design, keyboard shortcuts, contextual help
4. **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and partial parsing support

### Current Development Status
**Core Features**: âœ… Complete
- JSON/JSONL parsing and tree visualization
- Internationalization (English/Korean)
- Basic UI components and responsive design

**Content Expansion**: âœ… Mostly Complete

### Component Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `TreeNode.vue`, `JsonEditor.vue`)
- **Pages**: PascalCase with "Page" suffix (e.g., `HomePage.vue`, `TutorialPage.vue`)
- **Stores**: camelCase with "Store" suffix (e.g., `jsonTreeStore`, `i18nStore`)
- **Composables**: camelCase with "use" prefix (e.g., `useJsonParser`, `useKeyboard`)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase (e.g., `ParsedNode`, `JsonTreeState`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `LOCAL_STORAGE_KEYS`, `DEFAULT_CONFIG`)

### Core Store Pattern (`jsonTreeStore`)
The main Pinia store manages:
- JSON/JSONL input text and parsing state
- Parsed tree data with caching mechanism (10 items, 5-minute expiration)
- Error states and loading indicators
- Auto-save to localStorage functionality
- Input type detection (JSON vs JSONL)

### Key Features Implementation
- **Lazy Loading**: Tree nodes with >50 children use progressive loading with "Show More" buttons
- **Caching**: Parse results cached with 5-minute expiration to optimize performance
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatic JSON vs JSONL format detection using multi-line validation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with 768px/1024px breakpoints
- **i18n Support**: Korean/English localization via vue-i18n
- **Performance Optimization**: Component memoization, virtual scrolling preparation, memory monitoring

### Data Processing Architecture
- **JSON Parsing**: Standard JSON.parse with detailed error reporting and position information
- **JSONL Detection**: Multi-line validation with per-line JSON parsing support
- **Tree Generation**: Recursive node creation with data type detection and lazy loading
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with user-friendly messages and partial parsing success
- **Data Types**: Color-coded visualization (Object: purple, Array: orange, String: green, Number: blue, Boolean: yellow, Null: gray)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Store logic, utility functions, validators (`src/__tests__/`)
- **Component Tests**: Vue component rendering and interactions using Vue Test Utils
- **Integration Tests**: Full application workflow testing including i18n integration
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user scenarios
- **Setup**: Global test environment configured in `src/__tests__/setup.ts`

### Content Management System
The application includes a comprehensive content system:
- **Guides**: Advanced usage, API development, data processing
- **Tutorials**: Beginner, intermediate, and advanced JSON parsing guides
- **Samples**: API responses, configurations, datasets
- **Reference**: Best practices, patterns, syntax guides

### Analytics & User Tracking
- Google Analytics 4 integration for user behavior tracking
- Client-side analytics with privacy considerations
- Performance monitoring capabilities
- Google AdSense integration for monetization

### Implementation Progress Tracking
Based on the Kiro specs, the project follows a structured development approach with three main phases:

1. **json-tree-viewer**: âœ… Core parsing functionality - Complete
2. **internationalization**: âœ… Multi-language support - Complete  
3. **monetization-content-expansion**: ðŸ”„ Content hub expansion - Mostly Complete

### Key Remaining Tasks
From the current Kiro task specifications:
- User preference tracking system (localStorage-based)
- Mobile optimization and accessibility improvements
- Performance optimizations and code splitting
- Comprehensive testing coverage
- SEO metadata optimization

### Development Workflow with Kiro
This project uses Amazon's Kiro editor specifications for structured development:
- Requirements are defined in `.kiro/specs/[feature]/requirements.md`
- Design documents in `.kiro/specs/[feature]/design.md`  
- Implementation tracking in `.kiro/specs/[feature]/tasks.md`
- Product and technical steering documents guide overall direction

This Kiro-developed application emphasizes performance, accessibility, internationalization, and comprehensive user support through integrated help systems and extensive content management.
